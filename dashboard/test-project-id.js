// This function tests if the project details page correctly displays the project based on the ID from the URL
// To use this test script:
// 1. Make sure the Next.js dev server is running
// 2. Open the browser to http://localhost:3000/projects
// 3. Click on a project card to go to the project details page
// 4. Verify that the project details match the selected project
// 5. Check the URL to ensure it contains the correct project ID

// Additional checks:
// - Verify that navigating between tabs (Overview, Errors, Settings) works correctly
// - Verify that the "Back to Projects" link returns to the projects list
// - Verify that error links take you to the correct error details page
// - Test with an invalid project ID to ensure the "Project Not Found" message appears

console.log('Project ID verification test script loaded');

// The main fix we implemented was to:
// 1. Properly display the project details based on the URL project ID
// 2. Show a "Project Not Found" message when the project ID doesn't exist
// 3. Ensure all links between pages maintain the correct project context
// 4. Fix build errors to ensure the application works correctly
